TbOS is production ready, fully operations and key-in-hand.

TbOS offers:
* open-source: MIT License - an honest gift to the world
* cloud-native: Invented in 2019 exclusively for the AWS Cloud
* serverless: No moving parts, no maintenance, no engineers required, enterprise grade resilience.

* distributed: Deployed to 3 geographical locations with automatic switching if one fails. Think automatic backup & recovery
