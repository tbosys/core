We are building a software system for small and medium companies to run their business with fair costs

#### A business operating system involves everything a company requires to do business
* Enterprise Grade Databases and longterm digital information storage (AWS-RDS AWS_S3)
* Web Platform to login with role-based access to startup grade apps (React-MaterialUI-AWS_S3-AWS_Cloudfront)
* Web Server to model and constantly improve how business is done (AWS_Lambda-NodeJS)
* Engineering Grade Developer Tools & Workflows for continuous limitless system development
* Plug&Play access to the full AWS Cloud Services Catalog

#### TbOS is production ready, fully operations, key-in-hand
* #open-source: MIT License - an honest gift to the world
* #cloud-native: Invented 2019 exclusivley for the AWS Cloud
* #serverless: Not moving parts, no maintenance, no engineers required.
* #medium-code: Coding is required to create and change apps - we don't believe in click&build.
* #distributed: Deployed to 3 geografical locations with automatic switching if one fails. Think automatic backup & recovery


## SOLUTION
Just like macOS and LinuxOS are a software layer that empowers people to create digital content. TbOS is a cloud software layer that empowers organizations to create and run digital operations.

TbOS is the organization’s core software system that communicates with AWS Cloud to allow business data like orders, invoices, prices, and reservations to flow between apps.

It’s the blueprint that defines how traditional business processes are mapped into desktop/mobile apps, the path to enhance them with artificial intelligence with machine learning and the enterprise-grade components used to build and constantly improve them.

Every company has a computer system of some sort, but not a unified, core business operating system that allows them to constantly improve their business model and operations by tapping into the latest technologies, on time.

## MARKET 
TBOS is for small and medium organizations that recognize technology as a high-value-added activity and are searching for ways to take ownership of their software with their own professional and capable team.

Follow an existing arquitecture with real life examples and use cases. Use to deploy your "Next Generation CRM+ERP" and your Customer Facing Desktop and Apps.

## MODEL

TBOS is a cloud-native, open-source project and its core values are correctly aligned with sound business best practices. It's a serious project with advanced governance, enterprise licensing and most importantly a for-profit open-source cooperative of developers that's laser aligned with customer success.

## Get Started Immediately
You don’t need to install or configure tools and services.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Philosophy

No Configuration Required: You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

No Lock-In: You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## What's Included

* Admin Web & Mobile Single Page Application.
* Perfomant Real World API Server.
* Managed Database with autobackup and restore. Multi-AZ.
* CI/CD code pipeline for staging and production enviroments ( DB, API's, UI ) with rollback.
* Email based passwordless authentication and JWK based auhotizations
* Role and Profile based user access with row lever sharing.
* Step Functions for long running background processes such as PDF generation and invoice printing.

## Customization and Composition

* UI is automatically generated at compile time from UI JSON SCHEMA files. 
* UI Automatic generation is Opt-in. Each route isolated. Developers get complete access and dependency managment.
* API is automatically generated at runtime from API JSON SCHEMA files.
* API automatic generation is Opt-in. Each route is isolated both in code and execution. Developers can overwrite queries or mutations simply by generating a file. Full server access.
* DB is automatically generated at compile time from KNEX Migration files.
* Full database control (RDS) and direct db connection.

## Primary Open Source Dependencies

* React
* Material UI Componentes
* Serverless Framework
* GraphQl
* Knex

## Cloud Services
* AWS Gateway API
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Step Functions
* AWS RDS ( MYSQL & Postgres )
* AWS Dynamo DB
* AWS Route 53
* AWS Code Pipeline
* AWS Cloudwatch
* AWS SNS & AWS SQS & AWS SES


## Sponsorhip and Cooperation

TBOS is based on the Github Sponsorship program. Companies using TBOS are expected to sponsor the project and the work of their developers.

The project is set up as a cooperative where profit from sponsorhips is divided by the active developers of the project.

## Participation & Coolaborotation
There are various levels of participation

## Governance & Inclusing and Diversity
Diversity is critical to proper governance, diferent open minded perspectives are the basis for sustainable progress and prosperity.

We are always looking for people with next generation  mindsets to join the project and help us evolve our democratic excersice.

There are several layers of governance required in The Business Operating System.
* Tecnical Level Quality Assurance and Monitoring
* Roadmap Level auditing and 
* Executive level planning.
