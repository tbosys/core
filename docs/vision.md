# The Business Operating System (TBOS) PROPOSAL

- by @rodriguezartav NOV 2019

Switching software that’s used to run business operations feels like a leap of faith. The complexities of leaving the current software comfort zone keep decision-makers from taking control of tech assets even when it’s not recommended to outsource high-value-added activities such as software.

Most people call their systems CRM or ERP, but they actually mean the core business operating system. It’s the missing part of the cloud puzzle, it’s constantly being reinvented and every organization, digital or not, needs one.

## PRODUCT

The Business Operating System is a fully operational, pre-configured business software that enables companies to start creating their digital operations right away while growing their tech team and migrating core business operations on the background. Naturally incorporating next-generation cloud services like AI voice robots (Alexa) and AI forecasting.
