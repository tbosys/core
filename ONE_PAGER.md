# The Business Operating System (TBOS)

## PROBLEM
Most companies struggle to take advantage of the amazing developments in cloud computing.
Business operations are limited by their legacy or SaaS CRM/ERP, but replacing business software feels like a leap of faith, yet most sales and marketing executives find it normal to be limited by their software.

By outsourcing a high-value-added activity like software, organizations are missing out on the competitive advantage of cloud computing, leading to static business models and uncreative cultures. Companies that want to be creative with business software have no other way but to start from scratch.

## SOLUTION
Just like macOS and LinuxOS are a software layer that empowers people to create digital content. TbOS is a cloud software layer that empowers organizations to create and run digital operations.

TbOS is the organization’s core software system that communicates with AWS Cloud to allow business data like orders, invoices, prices, and reservations to flow between apps.

It’s the blueprint that defines how traditional business processes are mapped into desktop/mobile apps, the path to enhance them with artificial intelligence with machine learning and the enterprise-grade components used to build and constantly improve them.

Every company has a computer system of some sort, but not a unified, core business operating system that allows them to constantly improve their business model and operations by tapping into the latest technologies, on time.
MARKET TBOS is for small and medium organizations that recognize technology as a high-value-added activity and are searching for ways to take ownership of their software with their own professional and capable team.

## MODEL

TBOS is a cloud-native, open-source project and its core values are correctly aligned with sound business best practices. It's a serious project with advanced governance, enterprise licensing and most importantly a for-profit open-source cooperative of developers that's laser aligned with customer success.
