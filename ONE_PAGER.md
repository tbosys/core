## The Business Operating System (BOS)

# Problem
It’s not recommended to outsource high-value-added activities such as the software used to run businesses, or being tied to proprietary platforms like Salesforce, Sap, and Microsoft.

Typical software platforms and Saas offerings have an intrinsic contradiction, in order to grow at a sufficient rate to attract investors, they must constrain the supply of technology and protect their intellectual property - which affects innovation at the customer level.

Modernizing operating software on your own feels like a leap of faith. Fear of leaving the current software comfort zone keep decision-makers from taking control of high-value-added tech assets.

# Vision
The Business Operating System is built for organizations that recognize technology as a high value added activity and are searching for ways to take control by building a professional and capable team while outsourcing other low value-added activities such as maintenance, hardware, and infrastructure.

The Business Operating system has a clear vision, it's cloud-native, open-source and it's core values are correctly aligned with sound business best practices. It's a serious project with advanced governance, enterprise licensing and most importantly a for-profit open-source cooperative of developers that's laser aligned with customer success.

By extending well-architected code, junior developers quickly learn best practices from senior software architects which turn attract high performing resources ( A Players) which improves the business culture.

# Solution
The Business Operating System works like traditional operating systems such as macOS, Android, or Windows. Empowering anyone to create digital content.

BOS empowers every company to evolve into digital businesses and get out of the way once it’s done. Blueprints with fully operational modules, designed to be owned internally allow companies to get started right away with their urgent requirements while migrating core business operations on the background and naturally incorporating next-generation cloud services like AI voice robots (Alexa) and AI forecasting.

The missing part of the cloud puzzle it's constantly being reinvented. People call it CRM or ERP,  but it's actually the core business operating system - every organization, digital or not, needs one.
