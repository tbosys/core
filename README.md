# The business Operating System

An Open Source, cloud native, operating system for business processes and data managment. 

A "medium-code" platform, meaning javascript coding is required but developers can follow an existing arquitecture with real life examples and use cases. Use to deploy your "Next Generation CRM+ERP" and your Customer Facing Desktop and Apps.

* For a one click install check the Starter Project & CLI
* For a demo checkout the Example Projects in /examples

## Get Started Immediately
You don’t need to install or configure tools and services.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Philosophy

No Configuration Required: You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

No Lock-In: You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## What's Included

* Admin Web & Mobile Single Page Application.
* Perfomant Real World API Server.
* Managed Database with autobackup and restore. Multi-AZ.
* CI/CD code pipeline for staging and production enviroments ( DB, API's, UI ) with rollback.

## Customization and Composition

* UI Automatic generation is Opt-in. Each route isolated. Developers get complete access and dependency managment.
* API is automatically generated at runtime from API JSON SCHEMA files.
* API automatic generation is Opt-in. Each route is isolated both in code and execution. Developers can overwrite queries or mutations simply by generating a file. Full server access.
