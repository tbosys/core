# Table Apps

There are two types of tabular apps.

## List Tables

TODO

## Process Tables

TODO

## Customization y Composition

For the least amount of code required, developers have access to the area between the toolbar and the table. On this area you can create action buttons that react to selected rows or Fab buttons that can be triggered independently of selected rows.

For medium-code modification simply use the file components/Table/ListWrapper or components/Table/ProcessWrapper as the basis for your app.

For full code modification use copy the file components/table/index.js
